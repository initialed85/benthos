:::caution EXPERIMENTAL
This component is experimental and therefore subject to change or removal outside of major version releases.
:::
Decodes [Parquet files](https://parquet.apache.org/docs/) into a batch of structured messages.

Introduced in version 4.4.0.

```yml
# Config fields, showing default values
label: ""
parquet_decode:
  byte_array_as_string: false
```

This processor uses [https://github.com/segmentio/parquet-go](https://github.com/segmentio/parquet-go), which is itself experimental. Therefore changes could be made into how this processor functions outside of major version releases.

By default any BYTE_ARRAY or FIXED_LEN_BYTE_ARRAY values will be copied as `[]byte` values as they could contain arbitrary data. This means that when serialising messages as JSON documents these values will by default be base 64 encoded into strings, which is the default for arbitrary data fields. It is possible to convert these binary values to strings (or other data types) using Bloblang transformations such as `root.foo = this.foo.string()` or `root.foo = this.foo.encode("hex")`, etc.

However, in cases where all BYTE_ARRAY values are strings within your data it may be easier to set the config field `byte_array_as_string` to `true` in order to automatically extract all of these values as strings.

## Fields

### `byte_array_as_string`

Whether to extract BYTE_ARRAY and FIXED_LEN_BYTE_ARRAY values as strings rather than byte slices. Enabling this field makes serialising the data as JSON more intuitive, otherwise the byte slice fields should be mapped via [Bloblang](/docs/guides/bloblang/about) in order to extract meaningful values.


Type: `bool`  
Default: `false`
